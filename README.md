# Mr-Bird-2-Corona-SDK-Android-Game
Inverse of my Mr Bird Game Check it out from here : https://github.com/RudraJikadra/Mr-Bird-Corona-SDK-AndroidGame.
All the code files of lua language with icon images are provided along with the apk file.
It is not another clone of Flappy Bird but a different approach of that kind of arcade game.
The bird is falling down and tiles are moving up and we have to dodge them and increase the score by making the bird move left or right.

### features
Easy to understand lua language.
With Revmob Ad support in the code.
And also with Vungle Video Ads support to grant an extra life if the player looses.

### How to play
Screen is divided into two halfs vertically.
If user taps on the right side of the phone then the bird will get a force upwards and to the right, the same goes for the left side.

A pretty simple game easy to understand the lua language.
